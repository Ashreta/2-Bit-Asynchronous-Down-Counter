# 2-Bit Asynchronous Down Counter
The aim is to design and analyse a 2-Bit Asynchronous Down Counter using Cadence SCL 180nm technology. Firstly, we designed a negative edge triggered Toggle Flipflop (T- Flipflop) by connecting two T - latches in  master - slave configuration. The main tasks include schematic design, Pre-layout simulation, Layout, Layout verification and Post layout simulation.
